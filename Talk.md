# The talk

## What is Assumed
* Basic knowledge of programming (ability to read code, data types, inheritance etc.)

## Some background knowledge
* Ethereum's schtick is that it has a turing complete programming language, [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) that allows for easy development on the blockchain.
* Applications that involve the Ethereum blockchain are known as DAPPS (Distributed Applications)
* The blockchain is analogous to the database on a DAPP. You still need to make a front end.
	* How do you connect the front end to the database? [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/)


## Getting Started
* Navigate to [remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljson-v0.4.17+commit.bdeb9e52.js)
* install [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) Ethereum Wallet
	* Must use with Google Chrome
	* Go to the site
	* Click on the "Get Metamask link"
	* Add Metamask to Chrome
	* A little fox should now appear in the top right corner of your browser
	* Click on the fox
	* Create a password
	* REMEMBER ALL DATA YOU ENTER INTO THIS!!! THIS IS A LIVE ETHEREUM WALLET!!!
	* Store the mnemonic phrase and the password to the wallet somewhere safe
	* Yay you're done

## Now that you have Metamask installed...
There are four live Ethereum blockchains. One is the "Mainnet", and the other three are "Testnets". In the top left corner of Metamask, you will see a dropdown. Click on it and you'll see the networks. We'll be using Ropsten. Ropsten lets you test your contracts with fake Ether. Yay for not spending money on learning.
